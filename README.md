Rclone *("rsync for cloud storage")* is a command line program to sync files and directories to and from different cloud storage providers.

At FirePress we use rclone to do cold storage backup outside our clusters.

## Â« Dockerfile CI everything Â» requirements
To Â« dockerfile CI everything Â» we need to keep a consistent format by defining a few **variables**. Thanks to **Github Actions**, it's now very quick to set up a CI for your Dockerfile (and every project really). By setting these variables, your Dockerfile will build consistently for every project you manage.

**1) In the Dockerfile, update:**

```
ARG APP_NAME="rclone"
ARG VERSION="1.49.0"
```

**2) In the dockerfile_ci.yml, update:**

It's under `./git_repo/.github/workflows/dockerfile_ci.yml`

```
echo "devmtl" > DOCKERHUB_USER
```

**3) In the Github repo, add:**

It's under `settings/secrets`

```
DOCKER_PASSWORD
```

You see the beauty of this? Assuming you have a valid Dockerfile, you only have to set four environment variables, and you are doing CI like a chef and making the world a better place.

## Hacking Github Actions

**Github actions and environment variables**

At this moment (August 2019), it's tricky to use variables with Github Actions. [The issue](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/issues/68) is that when you set variable in an **action**, further actions can NOT use these variables. What!?

**Here is where the hack comes to play**. To avoid this limitation, we write variables on disk then `cat` them later. 

See the Â« Action Â» **A) Define VARs in** `./git_repo/.github/workflows/dockerfile_ci.yml`

From [Github docs](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#github_token-secret):

<br>

## Run the container

```
docker run --rm -it devmtl/rclone:1.49.0_2019-08-26_11H19s19_e89c3ce
```

<br>

## Docker hub

Always check on docker hub the most recent build:
https://hub.docker.com/r/devmtl/rclone/tags

Use the tag from this format:

```
1.49.0_2019-08-26_11H19s19_e89c3ce
```

The tag contains three information:
- version
- build date
- hash commit
